    "The goal of a recommendation engine is to match items to users that will prefer them. We can imagine this being extremely useful across a wide variety of e-commerce applications, for starters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this recommendation engine, we start with a set of user ratings. We can use these historical ratings to make guesses about which future items a user will rate highest.  In this tutorial, we will cover two ways of doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content-based rating:** We can make this guess based only on features of the users or items.\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Rating:** We could also look at ratings of similar users or similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example data set, we are using the [MovieLens 10M dataset](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip).  This contains about 10M ratings for 10k movies by 72k users.  We will be building applications that attempts to present movies that a given user would rate highly.  Extracting the zip file in the current directory should create a directory called `ml-10M100K/`.  The data wil be in several `.dat` files.  Let's take a look at the list of movies."

The posterior estimate of the rating, after seeing the $n$ reviews $\\{x_i\\}$, can be written as\n",

    "## A Brief Aside: The Hashing Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "In many NLP and text-based analysis applications, one-hot encoding each word into its own column can prove extremely expensive, and doesn't boost a model's performance. This is typically known as the *curse of dimensionality*. Instead, we can attempt to take advantage of two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fact that most English words (and in this case, tags) are used infrequently. This is known as [zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).\n",
    "2. The structured randomness of hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we can use a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to map our words to one of `N` bins with uniform randomness. Given that if we point at two random words in the dictionary, it's likely that they will be common words, we get the property that only very uncommon words will collide in the dimensionally reduced feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hashing trick isn't the best candidate here, but we still demonstrate it."

    "3. Add in the year as a feature of movies.  Should it be a continuous or categorical variable?  While it's likely that a user who likes movies from 1970 will also like movies from 1971 (suggesting a continuous feature), a user liking movies from 1970 and 1990 is no guarantee that they like movies from 1980 (suggesting a categorical feature).  Can you find an encoding that's in between these two options?  How does the scale of the year, if treated as a continuous feature, affect the KNN calculation?  You may want to use a `StandardScaler`, from `sklearn.preprocessing`, to reduce this effect.\n",

    "4. In weighting reviews, we consider not reviewing a movie to be less of a recommendation that scoring it a one.  Shift the rating scale to change this, and see how the affects the resultant recommendations."
